## Country Information Project

For this project, the user is able to select a country's flag and read up some tidbits about that specific country. Such details include the country's capital, motto and a historical fact. An image is provided to showcase where the country is located on the global scale. The project is designed to give information to the users about each specific country and hopefully gain some more knowledge about it's geographical features and historical place in the world.
